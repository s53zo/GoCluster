Topic Protocol Description
DX Info PC61^DXfreq^DXcall^date^time^comment-txt^user
rprt^origin-node^user-ip^hops^~
P61 is a replacement for PC11
originating with Lee Sawkins, VE7CC.
PC61 differs by allowing several
significant digits after the frequency
decimal. All other fields are the same,
except for an added originating user IP
address. The user IP can be IPv4 or
IPv6.
General Info PC9x^<node call>^<seconds since last midnight>^...
<seconds since last midnight> is the
number of seconds since the beginning
of "today" UTC. It *MUST* be unique
and increase with each sentence. It can
therefore be a decimal number. The
idea being that if the next sentence is
sent in the same second as the last one,
then you append (for instance) '.01' on
the end. If there is an other one: .02 etc.
But you add any number of decimal
points (eg '.1' or '.001') you like. Look at
gen_pc9x_t in DXProtHandle.pm for an
example.
At midnight, they all go back to 0.

See breakdown below
PC92 - Routing
The biggest change is that nodes only (ever) send their configuration (using a PC92) and the
configuration of any *directly connected* "traditionally routing" nodes (TNODES) (ie still using
PC16,17,19,21). The config stored of any TNODES is limited only to the local users on those nodes.
Anything else is kept as hints, but is not transmitted onward, neither to other PC9x nodes nor other
TNODES. The only configuration that other TNODES will see are the composite of all the PC92
nodes's configs + any other locally connected TNODES.
PC92 Nodes periodically output their configuration. Failure to receive a config after 3 update periods
will cause that node's config to be erased (and the changes to be propagated to any connected
TNODEs). Think OSPF.
All PC9x sentences contain a timestamp and the originating node call. This allows any of these
sentences to be deduplicated and deliberate loops (for routing and new other functions) will allow
things to continue to work as only "new" PC9x sentences will be processed.
All PC9x sentences are passed onto neighbouring PC9x unaltered apart from a decremented hop
count.

GB7TLH - Originating Node

'C' current configuration record
'A' records add nodes or users
'D' records delete nodes or users.
'K' keep alive records
5GB7TLH:5457
5 is a bit map which is made up like this:
Bit 1 - here/not here
Bit 2 - external, traditional PC protocol node
Bit 4 - Node
1 - User/here
4 - Node/not here - here flag is unset
5 - Node/here
7 - Traditional PC node/here
GB7TLH is the callsign
:5457 is the version number, other fields may be tacked on (see K record below)
The first slot after the 'C', 'A' or 'D', is always reserved for the node call. This slot may be empty (as in
...^A^^1G1TLH^... as opposed to ..^A^5GB7TLH^1G1TLH^..) if the node is the same as the node call
after PC92. Any software must be able to cope with this empty slot. The remaining payload...

DXSpider PC Packet Cluster Protocol - DXSpider Documentation Wiki
Note that DXSpider converts PC16/17/19/21 from *directly* connected PC only nodes into PC92 that
look like:
PC92^GB7TLH^78042^C^7GB7DJK-1:5453^1G1TLH-1^H99^
This means that GB7TLH has PC node GB7DJK-1 with user G1TLH-1 attached to it.
The principle being used here is similar to protocols like OSPF. A node *only* sends records that
either come from it or PC nodes that it is "responsible" for. Nodes do *not* splurge out their local view
of the network to cause even more confusion...
'K' Record Examples - Keep Alive

The first for the main PC9X handling node and the second for an attached Legacy PC protocol node.
The two fields at the end are <no of nodes> and <no of users> respectively. You should note the
similarity of this and the traditional PC50.
PC93 - Talk/Announce/WX
PC93^<node call>^<timestamp>^<to>^<from>^<via>^<text>[^<onode>][^<IPaddr>]^H99
NOTES:
 * any ^ characters in <text> MUST be converted to %5E
 * <to> can be a callsign (a talk), if I can route to it, I treat it as a talk.
WX (for weather).
SYSOP (sysop announcements).
<string> which is not recognised as a callsign by pattern recognition and is taken as a CHAT
group (eg: LOGGER, #9000).
 * (announce/full).
 * <from> is the from users callsign
 * <via> constrains whether it goes via a particular node set to * for now.

* <onode> is optional and is used when passing PC93s o.b.o non-PC9x handling nodes. Not
currently used.
This is an announce:
PC93^IZ7AUH-6^79200^*^IZ7AUH-6^*^IZ7AUH-6 DX CLUSTER -> dx.iz7auh.net port
8000^^XX.XX.XX.XX^H97^
This a talk:
PC93^GB7TLH^81701^WR3D-2^G1TLH-2^*^wot?^H98^
This is a Chat message:
PC93^GB7TLH^81745^#9000^G1TLH-2^*^#48 anybody on?^H96^
Note that for backwards compatibility all chat <text> sections have a serial number #1->#999 + a
space added to it. The first chat message sent after restart should be a random no in that range. This is
designed to defeat any de-duping on announces.
Initial Connection Process
There is no "initial handshake" as such for nodes at this level. You are not a node until you have
successfully logged in as a known entity to a node. Only at that point does PC protocol happen - if you
are defined as a node with that callsign - on the node that you are attempting to connect to. 
Otherwise you will be treated as a user, given the contents of any MOTD file and sent a user prompt.
So if one connects to a PC92 capable node; you have successfully logged with user (+password if
required); that username is a callsign that is recognized as a node by the receiving node; you are not
locked out there (the default for some random node callsign)  -  then this happens (GB7TLH-2
connecting to GB7DJK) as shown from the receiving node's (GB7DJK) point of view:

Actual data transfer data green = GB7DJK (receiving node) red = GB7TLH-2 (connecting node).
The stuff in black is normal logging on the receiving node (GB7DJK) - and not passed across this
connection.
Connecting to an old style PC protocol node is much more verbose but the PC18 -> PC20 -> PC22
pattern is the same. It just has a big flurry of PC19/PC17 records in between these three markers. The
principle is the same.
