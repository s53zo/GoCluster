Goal: Add WWV/WWC delivery to telnet clients with filters and formatted output.

Planned steps (when implementing):
1) Filter support
   - Extend filter.Filter with an AllowWWV flag (default true, migration-safe).
   - Add PASS WWV / REJECT WWV commands and SHOW FILTER WWV output.
   - Update help/usage strings and saved filter serialization.
2) Telnet broadcast path
   - Add telnet.Server.BroadcastWWV that fans WWV bulletins to clients honoring AllowWWV.
   - Decide formatting: stable human line (e.g., “WWV SFI=… A=… K=… origin=… time=…”) rather than raw PC frames.
3) Peer handling
   - Parse PC23/PC73 into a WWVEvent and call BroadcastWWV with hop handling; forward to peers via PC23/73 with hop–1.
4) Tests
   - Filter command tests (PASS/REJECT/SHOW WWV) and BroadcastWWV filtering behavior.
   - Peer WWV parse/forward test to ensure hop decrement and formatting.
5) Docs
   - Update HELP text and README to mention WWV/WWC delivery and filtering.
